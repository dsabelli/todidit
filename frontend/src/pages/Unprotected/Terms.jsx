          Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not
          be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these

          provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms
          constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service and
          supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have had between
          us regarding Service.

        <P>
          No waiver by Company of any term or condition set forth in Terms shall
